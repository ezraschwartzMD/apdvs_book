## Pre/Post Questions

### Case Based Questions

1.  A 77-year-old female with a past medical history of CAD, CHF with an EF of 14%, COPD, and a prior total thyroidectomy comes in for evaluation of carotid stenosis. She had a TIA with a right-sided facial droop two weeks ago and was briefly admitted to this hospital. She had a carotid US and was found to have an 85% left carotid stenosis. *Which of the following treatment modalities would be best suited for the patient?* 

A.    Open carotid endarterectomy

B.    Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)

C.    No intervention because of her age

D.    No intervention because of her medical comorbidities 

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**B. Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)**

Discussion: Considering the patient has a symptomatic carotid artery lesion, her disease warrants treatment. This rules out answers C and D. TCAR is a safe, minimally invasive surgical technique used to treat carotid artery disease. TCAR and other endovascular procedures are often a safer option in the elderly, medically comorbid patients, especially those who have a higher risk of complications (such as those with prior neck surgery). In addition, TCAR can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation. This makes TCAR a safer option relative to open CEA, making B a better answer than C.

2.  A 66-year-old male presents to the emergency room one week after a percutaneous coronary intervention via right groin access. He reports that over the last few days, he has noticed a bulge in his groin and when he touches it, it is painful and has a pulsatile nature. A complete exam reveals a pulsatile, tender mass in the right groin with no skin changes, but with a bruit on auscultation. *Which of the following complications is NOT associated with this patient's diagnosis?*  

A.    Embolization to the lower extremity

B.    Rupture of the mass

C.    True femoral artery aneurysm 

D.    Compression of the femoral vein

E.    Gangrene of the toes

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**C. True femoral artery aneurysm **

Discussion: In the post-intervention patient who presents with a pulsatile tender mass at the intervention site with a bruit on auscultation, the most likely diagnosis is a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. Risks of an untreated PSA include embolic events, distal ischemia including gangrene, rupture of the PSA, skin necrosis, and compression of surrounding structures including the femoral vein and nerve. Because a PSA is an outpouching of only 1 or 2 of the layers of the arterial wall, a true aneurysm (outpouching of all three layers of the artery, intima, media, and adventitia) is not associated with a femoral PSA.

3.    A 42-year-old patient with a history of an arterial thrombus four years ago presents to the ER with severe right lower extremity pain. A CTA is obtained showing no atherosclerotic disease but with acute thrombus along the distal SFA and popliteal artery. You take the patient to the operating room for a lower extremity angiogram. *Which catheter would be most useful to help break up the clot over time?*  

A.    Penumbra thrombectomy catheter

B.    Cragg Mcnamara Catheter

C.    Fogarty Catheter

D.    Peripherally inserted central venous catheter 


::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**B. Cragg Mcnamara Catheter**

Discussion: In this case, the patient has an acute thrombus in her lower extremity arteries. Although there are many treatment options for this disease process depending on disease burden and characteristics, the question specifically asks about a catheter that can be used to break up the clot over time. The Cragg Macnamara catheter is a thrombolysis catheter that remains in place infusing “clot buster” medication (tPA) over a period of hours to days to dissolve the clot. A Penumbra thrombectomy catheter is used to suction blood clots out of a vessel. A Fogarty catheter can be used to manually withdraw thrombus from a vessel. A PICC line is used for long-term infusions to deliver medications to the central venous system and is not used intra-operatively for procedures.

4.    A 70-year-old male is brought to the operating room for an EVAR procedure for his 6 cm infrarenal AAA. You have chosen a graft to use and the nurse is asking if there are any wires that you would like opened to deliver the device into the patient's aorta. *Which of the following wires would be most useful for this task?*  

A.    0.018” flexible Terumo wire

B.    0.035” Amplatz wire

C.    0.035” floppy Glidewire

D.    0.014” Pilot wire

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**B. 0.035” Amplatz wire**

Discussion: Vascular access wires each have a variety of uses determined by their stiffness, diameter, hydrophilicity, and tip shape. In this case, a stiff wire to pass a large aortic endograft over would be the most useful. The larger diameter wire will be stiffer, which rules out options “A” and “D”, which would both be used for getting access to smaller vessels. Option C is a floppy glide wire which can be useful for crossing lesions and getting up and over the aortic bifurcation. The 0.035” Amplatz wire is a stiff guidewire that will not buckle under the pressure of passing a large device into the aorta. 
:::

5.   A 63-year-old smoker presents to the clinic with left lower extremity claudication and an ischemic ulcer. He is taken to the operating room for an angiogram via right groin access. *Which of the following steps is INCORRECT when obtaining arterial access?* 

A.    Using anatomic landmarks to confirm cannulation through the inguinal ligament

B.    Using ultrasound to ensure cannulation of the common femoral artery

C.    Using fluoroscopy to ensure puncture at the level of the femoral head

D.    Using the Seldinger technique for first access, making sure not to lose access to the artery during exchanges or wires and catheters. 


::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**A. Using anatomic landmarks to confirm cannulation through the inguinal ligament**

Discussion: On first access for an angiogram with right groin access, the right common femoral artery should be accessed. The CFA begins below the level of the inguinal ligament, making answer A incorrect. One should avoid going through the inguinal ligament as native fascial planes are disrupted and it can make for challenging upsizing of devices and closure. Following identification of the inguinal ligament; ultrasound, fluoroscopy, and the Seldinger technique should be used as above to safely cannulate the CFA.

## Introduction

Endovascular surgery is a minimally invasive approach to treat a variety of vascular pathologies including peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysms, venous diseases, and more. Endovascular surgery is not limited to vascular surgery as a specialty and is also employed by interventional cardiologists, neurosurgeons, interventional radiologists, and others. 

Over the past 30 years, endovascular surgery has dramatically changed the practice of vascular surgeons, decreasing patient morbidity and mortality in the immediate postoperative period and the length of hospital stay. 

Understanding endovascular surgery as a medical student or junior resident can be a difficult task due to the abundance of wires, catheters, sheaths, and devices used and orienting onself using fluorscopic images. In this chapter, we will focus on developing a conceptual basis for endovascular surgery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Anatomy and Vascular Access

The common femoral artery (CFA) is the most common site of access for endovascular surgery due to its larger size and lower risk of complications relative to other sites of vascular access. Other sites of arterial access include the radial, brachial, and axillary artery in the upper extremity, as well as the popliteal and dorsal pedal arteries in the leg. The further away the vessel is from the aorta, the smaller the vessel lumen, and hence the smaller the diameter of devices that can be utilized in that artery. 

The CFA is referred to as the external iliac artery proximal to the inguinal ligament and the superficial femoral artery (SFA) distal to the branching of the profunda femoris artery (PFA). The anatomic relationship of the CFA to the surrounding vessels can be remembered with the mnemonic “NAVeL”, femoral nerve, artery, vein, and lymph nodes from lateral to medial. The Femoral Triangle consists of these three vessels and nerves surrounded by the inguinal ligament superiorly, sartorius muscle laterally, and the adductor longus medially.

![Femoral triangle anatomy courtesty of S Bhimji, MD.](images/femoraltriangle.jpg){fig-align="left" width="50%"}

Correct anatomic positioning for cannulation of the CFA can be achieved by palpating the point of maximum pulsation inferior to the inguinal ligament, a structure identifiable by tracing along the facial plane between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic symphysis. The following imaging modalities assist with anatomic positioning: 

-   **Fluoroscopic guidance:** cannulation of the CFA should be attempted at the level of the middle to inferior femoral head. 

-   **Ultrasound (US) guidance:** identification of the PFA ensures cannulation is attempted of the CFA in place of the SFA. At the level where the great saphenous vein joins the femoral vein, US will show one large vessel surrounded by two smaller vessels, which can be remembered as the [“Mickey Mouse Sign.”](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mickey-mouse-sign-ultrasound)

:::

### Ultrasound Guided Access

There is emerging evidence to suggest real time identification of anatomic structures with US guidance may decrease the risk of access-related complications. A summary to the steps of US-guided access of the CFA are included below. 

#### Identifying the correct vessel: 

1.    Obtain baseline peripheral pulses.
2.    Obtain a **micropuncture kit,** containing a hollow needle, guidewire, and catheter
3.    Using the US probe, identify any plaque or calcification along the CFA or iliac artery that may change the site of access.
4.    Identify the CFA, which can be differentiated from the femoral vein by its thick wall, resistance to compression, pulsatility, and relative lateral anatomic positioning. A video identifying the CFA through the “Mickey Mouse Sign” on US is available [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fn__5YPyJc)

#### Obtaining access through the Seldinger technique: 

The Seldinger technique help obtain **safe** access to blood vessels. In contrast to previous methods, the Seldinger technique causes minimal damage to the blood vessel thereby allowing the puncture to be closed percutaneously, and avoids the risk of loss of access during the procedure through keeping at least one wire, catheter, or sheath at the site of interest in the body all times. 

Steps to the Seldinger technique are as follows:

1.    Cannulate the CFA by inserting the hollow needle at a 45-90 degree angle to the skin under US guidance, blood will flow out of the needle once inserted into the vessel.
2.    Insert the guidewire into the vessel.
Remove the hollow needle while keeping the guidewire in place, being careful not to allow the wire to withdraw as the needle is removed.
3.    Insert the catheter over the guidewire.
4.    Exchange the guidewire that came in the micropuncture kit with desired guidewire to begin the procedure. 

::: callout-tip
Please see [this video animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxX9VU_aPMQ) of the Seldinger technique for vascular access.
:::

#### Closure and Closure Devices

Once the procedure is complete, percutaneous access will need to be closed. If relatively small catheters and sheaths were used during the procedure, generally below 6 French (1F = .33 millimeter), arterial access may be closed with manual compression by applying pressure with two fingers over the site of incision against the femoral head. Alternatively, certain indications, such as use of anticoagulation or large body habitus, may require closure devices even if larger catheters or sheaths were not used during the procedure. 

There are several different types of closure devices. Each type can be differentiated by the use of suture or sealant to close the vessel. 

A common closure device you are likely to encounter on a vascular surgery service is the **Perclose ProGlide** (Abbott Vascular, Chicago, IL), a suture-mediated closure device. Other closure devices include the **Angioseal** (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), which deploys a bioabsorbable anchor to the arterial puncture site with surrounding collagen to promote closure, and the **MYNXGRIP** (Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL), which uses a balloon pressed against the site of arterial puncture and an adhesive sealant outside the vessel that dissolves slowly as the puncture site heals. Less commonly used closure devices include the **Angiosea**l (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), which deploys a bioabsorbable anchor to the arterial puncture site with surrounding collagen to promote closure. Other less commonly used closure devices include the **Manta, StarClose, Vascade, and Cardiva**. 

A step-by-step guide to deploying a **Perclose device** is shown in [this animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAO_YC48Dvo) and listed below. 

1.    Exchange the procedural sheath for a guide wire so only the guide wire is left in the vessel.
2.    Advance the flushed perclose device over the guidewire until the wire exit port is at skin level.
3.    Remove the guidewire so only the perclose device is in the vessel and advance the perclose device until blood flows out of the marker lumen.
4.    Lift the lever to open the foot of the device.
5.    Insert the plunger down to insert needles, which will connect the threads of the perclose .
6.    Remove the plunger, which pulls the thread taught, and cut the excess thread  
Lower the lever to close the foot and retract the device until the guide wire access port is visible.
7.    Reinsert guidewire and pull both threads taught.
8.    Use the Snared Knot Pusher or Prostyle Suture Trimmer to advance the knot to the level of skin.
9   Pull the thread taught while removing perclose device.
10.   Advance the knot over the guidewire and remove the guide wire once the bleeding is controlled. 
11.   Pull both threads tightly and remove the knot advancing device.

## Wires, Catheters, and Sheaths

::: callout-tip
Using the analogy of a train on a track passing through a tunnel, the catheter can be thought of as the train, the wire as the train track, and the sheath as the surrounding tunnel.
:::

### Wires

Wires are the first device inserted into a patient, have the lowest profile, and are variable in properties. Vascular access wires are made of a metal core and an outer wire wrapped around the metal core. They are used to guide devices such as catheters and sheaths into a vessel. Characteristics of wires include: 

#### Diameter

-   Wire diameter is described in thousandths of an inch and typically range from 0.010-0.038”. 
-   Vascular access is typically obtained with a 0.018” wire and is exchanged for a smaller or larger profile as needed. 
-   The most common sizes used are 0.035”, 0.018” and 0.014”.

#### Stiffness

-   Wire stiffness is determined by the metal used as the core of the wire. 
-   The same wire will become stiffer with a larger diameter. 
-   Softer wires are used to manipulate catheters into vessels. 
-   Stiffer wires are needed to push larger devices, such as balloons or endografts.

#### Coating

-   Wires have a hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating. 
-   Hydrophilic wires have less friction when moving along the vessel wall and track more closely along the vessel lumen, increasing the risk of dissection. 
-   Hydrophilic wires are preferable in highly tortuous vessels. 
-   In contrast, hydrophobic wires keep more distance from the vessel wall and are less likely to dissect. 

#### Tip Shape

-   The tip shape and consistency of the wire is important.
-   Angled tips are used to navigate into side branches of vessels. 
-   Soft tips are designed to prevent trauma to the vessel wall. 
-   Weighted tips are used to cross occlusions. 
-   J-tips are used to prevent wiring of too small of vessels that may lead to trauma of end organs. 

#### Length

-   Wires are measured in centimeters (cm) and typically range from 80 - 300 cm. 
-   Wires must not only be long enough to reach the target vessel from the point of access, but also need to be long enough to support exchanges outside of the body as needed. 
-   Care must be taken to avoid too long of a wire for its intended purpose as it is harder to control the end of the wire outside of the body. 

![Commonly used wires, curtosy of B. G. Northcutt, MD, A Shah, MD, Y Sheu, MD, L Carmi, MD.](images/wires.jpg){fig-align="middle" width="100%"}

#### Function

Wires can be categorized by function. Please find a list of each category with common examples of specific wires below.

##### Access wires: 

-   Short, typically 0.018” wires with a soft, non-directional tip to prevent any trauma to the vessel when entering, and a stiffer body to allow tracking of the introducer and sheath into the vessel.

##### Guidewires:

-   Generally are characterized as pushable, hydrophilic wires with a floppy, curved or angled tips that are designed to track through tortuous vessels without causing blunt trauma to the vessel wall. 
-   Guidewires are also used for their directionality to cannulate branches.
-   **Standard Glidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan):** can be used as an access or guidewire. Hydrophilic coating, straight or angled tip, sized 0.018” - 0.035” in diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
-   **Bentson (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN):** flexible wire with a hydrophobic coating and curved tip. Used to access vessels that have a slight curve, or to introduce catheters or sheaths. Comes in 0.035” diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length. 
-   **Rosen (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN):** stiff hydrophobic wire with J tip. Often used as the first wire exchanged for the access wire. 0.035” long and 80 cm to 260 cm in length. 

##### Rail wires:

-   Used as a platform to support catheter and sheath exchanges, as well as to advance devices, such as stents or endografts. 
-   Rail wires come in a range of stiffness, from medium to very stiff. 
-   They may have a straight, floppy, or curved tip.

*Medium stiffness rail wires:*

  -    **Bentson (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN):** flexible wire with a hydrophobic coating and curved tip. Used to access vessels that have a slight curve, or to introduce catheters or sheaths. Comes in 0.035” diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length. 
  -   **Rosen (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN):** stiff hydrophobic wire with J tip. Often used as the first wire exchanged for the access wire. 0.035” long and 80 cm to 260 cm in length. 

*High stiffness rail wires:*

  -   **Amplatz (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA):** stiff, hydrophobic, straight floppy or J-tip. 0.035” - 0.038” diameter and 75 cm - 260 cm in length. 
  -   **Lunderquist (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN):** one of the stiffest wires, hydrophobic, with floppy or curved tip. 0.035” diameter and 90 cm - 300 cm in length. Often used to advance large endografts. 
  
### Catheters

Catheters are flexible, hollow tubes that are used in both the diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease. 

::: callout-note
Catheters are measured in French (1F = 0.33 mm) and the diameter corresponds to the **outer diameter** of the tube.

![Outer diameter = OD, Inner diameter = ID.](images/ODID.jpg){fig-align="middle" width="50%"}
:::

Catheters vary by size, stiffness, hydrophilicity, radiopacity, and functionality, but can generally be described in two categories, flush catheters and selective catheters.

#### Flush catheters:

-   Contain multiple side holes just proximal to the end of the device to allow for the injection of contrast or other material, such as thrombolytics. 
- **Omniflush (Angiodynamics, Latham, NY):** soft, flexible catheter with a radiopaque tip that is able to administer contrast to visualize vessels. [Omniflush device on back table](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.4a5b0244f2e5f63cffb37b1b81d7655b?rik=JGXkMiGWf8YnMA&riu=http%3A%2F%2Fmyasiamed.com%2Fimages%2FMariner-Omni-Flush1.jpg&ehk=qI0yAEYrAScCyzwy7HCY6AdcYeqPSPo6aqTUJwh7tIw%3D&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)
-   **Pigtail (Angiodynamics, Latham, NY):** Similar to the Omniflush with a looped end (Image YY).

#### Selective catheters:

-   Contain one hole at the distal end of the tube. 
-   Selective catheters come in many different shapes and sizes. 
-   Intuitively, the anatomy of the vessel to be tracked will determine the diameter and tip shape. 
-   When attempting to cross the aortic bifurcation into the contralateral common iliac artery, a catheter with more of a J-tip or “Shepherd's hook” is preferable. 
-   When attempting to cannulate vessel branches with a more acute angle, a smaller angle catheter tip should be selected. 
-   Selective catheters can also be used to deliver contrast, but the contrast is only able to leave the catheter through the end of the device. 
-   Angiograms with selective catheters are more tailored to specific vessels, such as a renal or mesenteric artery. 
- **Selective Glidecath (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan):** hydrophilic catheter available in 17 different shapes, but the 45 degree is most common. Comes in 4F or 5F. Offers great trackability and pushability. [This image](https://www.terumois.com/products/catheters/glidecath/_jcr_content/content-par/columncontainer/column2_par/layout_container/grid-content-par/columncontainer_191691442/column1_par/columncontainer_547426510/column1_par/image_890878952.img.png/1604512081871.png) depicts some of the glidecath tip shapes.

### Sheaths

Sheaths are hollow tubes that provide a conduit between outer environment (i.e. outside the body) and the vessel. Returning to our train analogy, a sheath is the “tunnel” that the track and train run through. 

Sheaths are used to advance and exchange catheters, wires, stents, balloons, and other devices. Sheaths can be divided into short sheaths for access and long sheaths for diagnostics and treatment. Long sheaths are flexible enough to track along different vessels, but are also stiff enough to support the advancement or exchange of devices. 

::: callout-note
Sheaths are measured in French (1F = 0.33 mm) and the diameter corresponds to the **inner diameter** of the tube.

*As such, a 6F catheter will pass through a 6F sheath*
:::

Key points about sheaths: 

- Sheaths are measured based on the inner diameter of the sheath, in contrast to catheters, which are measured based on their outer diameter. 
-   Sheaths contain a removable introducer, which is used to expand the tract from the outside into the vessel, and provide a smooth transition between the wire and the sheath.
-   The side port on sheaths is used to flush the inner device with heparinized saline to prevent thrombus formation and distal embolization. It can also be used to inject contrast for diagnostic purposes. 
-   Sheaths come in variable diameters, lengths, and tips. 
-   Some sheaths, such as the **TourGuide (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN)** are steerable. The operator can deflect the sheath tip up to 180 degrees. This is advantageous when cannulating branch arteries with sharp angles.

It is also helpful to understand what diameter of sheath can be inserted into different points of access as this will change the approach for the procedure. Though there is variation across patients, the table below is a useful starting point to understand what size sheath can be inserted in target access arteries. 

| Artery         | Inner Diameter (mm)  | Typical Access Sheath size (F) |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Radial         | 2.3                  | 4-6                            |
| Brachial       |                      | 5-7                            |
| Axillary       |                      | 5-14                           |
| Common Femoral | 6.6                  | 5-24                           |
| Popliteal      | 4.7                  | 4-6                            |
| Pedal          | 2.1                  | 4                              |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Balloons, Stents, and Endografts

The delivery system for balloons consists of a catheter over the wire with the balloon built into the catheter tip. As such, advancing the balloon into place for angioplasty is no different from advancing a small catheter without a balloon.

Similar to balloons, stents are contained in catheters that are advanced into position over wires. The interventional component (i.e. stent) is near the tip of the catheter.

Both stents and balloons can elute drugs, most commonly *Paclitaxel,* an antiproliferative agent. Paclitaxel is lipophilic and remains active in the vessel wall following the procedure, preventing neointimal hyperplasia and improving patency.The impetus for using a drug-eluting stent or balloon in place of a standard stent or balloon is to decrease the chances of vascular remodeling following the procedure that may lead to restenosis. 

In contrast to drug-eluting stents, drug-eluting balloons have the advantage of not leaving hardware in the vessel after intervention. Contrarily, drug-eluting stents remain in the vessel lumen after intervention, but are able to continue providing radial force.

### Balloons

Balloons are versatile endovascular tools and can be categorized by the degree to which they assume of the shape of the vessel. 

**Compliant balloons: **
-   Compliant balloons inflate to a specific volume and *conform to the shape of the vessel.* 
-   For example, the **[Fogarty balloon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK4Mt__CYs)** is a compliant balloon that can be used to remove thrombi in both open and endovascular procedures.

**Semi-Compliant balloons:**
-   These balloons have a slightly more rigid shape and therefore conform to a lesser degree to the shape of the container (i.e. vessel). 
-   The **Coda balloon (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN)** is semi-compliant and used to temporarily occlude large vessels.

**Non-Compliant balloons:**
-   Non-compliant inflate to a predetermined shape and size. 
-   They are commonly used in angioplasty of peripheral and/or visceral stenosed vessels. 

![Angioplasty with a non-compliant balloon courtesty of J. Heuser, and Wikimedia.](images/angioplasty.jpg){fig-align="center" width="30%"}

Intraoperatively surgeons will often ask for the pressures of the balloon before using. 
Non-compliant balloons have a **nominal pressure,** which is the average pressure in atmospheres (atm) required to inflate the balloon to its *predetermined size,* and a **burst pressure,** where *99.9% of balloons will not burst if inflated to this pressure.* 

### Stents

Stents may be covered or uncovered. **Covered stents** do not allow flow between the lumen of the stent and surrounding tissues, in contrast to **uncovered (bare metal) stents** which do allow flow through the stent. 

Stents can be categorized by the means of deployment. 

**Self-expanding stents** use a recoil mechanism during deployment to achieve a set diameter using stored energy from the packing of the stent. 

Key characteristics of **self-expanding stents**: 

-   Flexible 
-   Low profile
-   Deformable 
-   Low radial force (lower dissection risk)


**Balloon-expandable stents** are packaged around a balloon. The surgeon uses the balloon inside the stent to achieve a specific diameter based on the pressure used to inflate the balloon. As the diameter of the stent increases with higher balloon pressure, the length of stent decreases. 

Key characteristics of **balloon-expandable stents**:

-   Rigid 
-   Large profile 
-   Maintains shape over time 
-   More accurate deployment
-   High radial force (higher risk of dissection) 

:::callout-tip
**Highly tortuous vessels** often require a **self-expanding stent** because of the increased flexibility needed to prevent kinking or in-stent restenosis. 

**Heavily calcified vessels** often require the increased radial force of **balloon-expandable stents** to achieve full patency.

### Gore Combat Manual

The [Gore Medical Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Combat Manual](https://www.goremedical.com/combat-manual) is an informative and entertaining read intended as a vascular surgery crash course for medical students, residents, and fellows alike. Highly accessible with a thoughtfully determined level of detail, but lacking in learning activities (e.g. questions, videos, etc.), this resource is a wonderful complement to the APDVS eBook.
