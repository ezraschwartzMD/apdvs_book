## Pre/Post Questions

### Case Based Questions

1.  A 45 year old vascular surgeon with 10 years of professional practice is preparing to perform a left upper extremity fistulogram due to concerns for prolonged bleeding after hemodialysis. *What is the most appropriate PPE that the student should wear during the case?*

<!-- -->

A.  Full leaded face shield, lead apron, and personal radiation badge

B.  Lead apron alone

C.  Leaded safety glasses

D.  Lower half of a 2-piece lead apron and thyroid shield

E.  Lead apron, leaded safety glasses

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**A. Full leaded face shield, lead apron, and personal radiation badge**

Discussion: The most appropriate PPE includes a full leaded face shield, lead apron, and radiation badge making answer a the correct answer. This will provide the most significant protection to the head and neck as well as vital organs of the body during the procedure. The radiation badge will help with long-term protection as it allows for cumulative tracking of exposure. A lead apron alone and or lead glasses alone is inadequate for optimal protection making answers b, c, and d incorrect. A full-face shield will be of greater protection than glasses which makes answer e incorrect.
:::

2.  A 25 year old medical student has been invited to observe endovascular stent placement for an infrarenal AAA. *In addition to wearing appropriate PPE, what can the medical student do to reduce their exposure during the case?*

<!-- -->

A.  Stand as close to the radiation source as possible.

B.  Turn their back to the radiation source.

C.  Stand as far from the radiation source as possible.

D.  Wear a radiation badge.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**C. Stand as far from the radiation source as possible.**

Discussion: Increasing one's distance from the radiation source is a key measure to to reduce radiation exposure. Radiation exposure decreases as the distance from the source increases. This phenomenon follows an inverse square law (1/d\^2). Standing close to the source will increase their radiation dose making answer a incorrect. If wearing a lead smock, turning one's back to the radiation source will render the PPE useless. If wearing a leaded vest and skirt, turning one's back has no effect. Wearing a radiation badge is beneficial for long-term monitoring of radiation exposure but does not affect the amount of radiation exposure.
:::

3.  A 55 year old vascular surgeon who has been practicing for 20 years has noticed some subtle changes in his vision. *What is the most likely underlying disease process?*

<!-- -->

A.  Optical neuropathy

B.  Glaucoma

C.  Opacification of the lens

D.  Retinal angiopathy

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**C. Opacification of the lens**

Discussion: The lens is the most radiosensitive componenet of the eye. Lens opacification (i.e. cataracts) is the most common adverse effect of radiation exposure to the eye. There was no mention of increased intraocular pressure or abnormal fundoscopic exam making answers a, b, and d incorrect.
:::

4.  A 65 year old female is presenting to the hospital for endovascular repair of a complicated AAA. There is prolonged radiation time with a calculated absorbed dose of 3.5 Gy. *What is the most likely skin exam finding during the patient's hospital course?*

<!-- -->

A.  Skin necrosis

B.  Burn

C.  No acute findings as the dose were too low

D.  Erythema

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**D. Erythema**

Discussion: With a dose of 3.5 Gy, the most likely result will be transient erythema between 2 to 24 hours from exposure. This can be found in table 2. Skin necrosis can occur, but it would need much higher doses making answer a wrong. It would be incorrect to say the dose is too low as 3.5 Gy making answer c invalid, and also below the threshold to cause a burn making answer b incorrect as well.
:::

5.  A 42 year old male on hemodialysis from a left upper extremity brachiocephalic fistula for CKD is seen for a fistulogram due the patient having trouble pulling during dialysis. The patient is placed in the supine position with left arm extended. The c-arm is initially perpendicular to the operating table. To achieve better views of the proximal vessels, the c-arm is rotated counterclockwise (from the perspective of looking from the patient's feet superiorly) so that the image intensifier is rotated more towards the patient's right shoulder. *What is the appropriate name for the c-arm position?*

<!-- -->

A.  LAO (left anterior oblique)

B.  RAO (right anterior oblique)

C.  Cranial

D.  Caudal

E.  AP (anterior posterior)

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**B. RAO (right anterior oblique)**

Discussion: When the image intensifier is rotated more towards the right shoulder, this is the RAO position making answer a correct. If the c-arm were rotated clockwise, with the c-arm over the left shoulder, this would be the LAO position. As no mention was made of rotating the c-arm towards the head or foot of the bed, answers c and d are incorrect. The AP position was the initial position of the c-arm when it is perpendicular to the OR table.
:::

6.  A 27 year old female who is a circulating nurse in the endovascular suite recently became pregnant. She has informed the radiation safety officer and staff of the endovascular suite. She is curious how best to monitor the radiation dose the fetus is receiving in utero. Where should the nurse place the fetal dosimetry badge?

<!-- -->

A.  The dosimetry badge should be worn on the outside of the lead apron at chest level

B.  The dosimetry badge should be worn under the lead apron around chest

C.  The dosimetry badge should be worn outside the lead apron at the abdomen level.

D.  The dosimetry badge should be worn under the lead apron at the abdomen level.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Answer

**D. The dosimetry badge should be worn under the lead apron at the abdomen level.**

Discussion: To monitor the dose to the unborn child, the dosimeter badge should be worn under the lead at the abdomen level, making answer d correct. We are concerned with the amount of radiation that is able to pass through proper PPE. Wearing the badge outside the lead apron will indicate the amount of radiation exposure in front of the shielding and not an approximate fetal dose making answers a and c incorrect. If the badge is worn at the level of the chest, the dose will also not be the most accurate, making answer b incorrect.

## Introduction

The use of radiation is fundamental to a vascular surgeon's practice. Intraoperative fluoroscopy, computer tomography (CT), and plain film X-rays (to a lesser extent) are crucial tools in vascular surgery. The vascular surgery patient will likely undergo all these radiation-based imaging studies.

Vascular surgeons and other professionals (nurses, scrub technicians, imaging technicians, etc.) can be exposed to significant levels of radiation over a career of performing intraoperative fluoroscopy/angiography and endovascular surgery. As the medical community is well aware of these risks, many initiatives are underway to decrease the amount of radiation required to perform studies and interventions.

Vascular patients are also exposed to radiation, although often at higher doses over shorter periods of time. Educating oneself about radiation and radiation safety is essential. This chapter will explore the basics of radiation, radiation safety principles and measures, and potential adverse outcomes of significant radiation exposure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Radiation Penetrance

A critical concept to understand when discussing occupational and patient exposure to radiation is penetrance.

-   **Penetrance** refers to the ability of emitted radiation to penetrate into or through materials and is defined as the fraction of radiation passing through a given object (or the inverse of attenuation).
-   The **density** of materials or tissues determines their **ability to attenuate or block X-rays.**
-   Dense tissues (bone) or materials (lead) absorb a greater fraction of radiation while less dense tissues (skin) or materials (water) allow for deeper penetration.

This concept is especially relevant to vascular surgeons and their patients as an increasing proportion of vascular procedures are performed endovascularly under live fluoroscopy which utilizes X-rays.

![Penetrating power of different types of radiation - alpha, beta, gamma and neutrons courtesty of Openclipart and Juhele. *X-rays have similar penetrance to gamma rays.*](images/penetrance.jpg){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

## Radiation types

Radiation can be broadly categorized into ionizing and non-ionizing forms. This chapter will focus on ionizing radiation, which is encountered by medical professionals in clinical settings.

Ionizing radiation falls within the higher frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The commonly discussed types of ionizing radiation include X-rays, alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays.

### Alpha Particles

Alpha particles, despite their high energy, have poor penetrance. As such, they do not penetrate the skin. However, they can be dangerous if inhaled or ingested.

### Beta Particles

Beta particles, have slightly more penetration than alpha particles.

They have some ability to penetrate the skin. However, they can be easily blocked by less dense shielding like aluminum.

Similar to alpha particles, beta particles can also cause harm if ingested or inhaled.

### Gamma Rays

Gamma rays possess significantly more energy and can penetrate through the human body and less dense shielding.

**Lead is effective in shielding against gamma rays due to its density.** Dense materials increase the likelihood of radiation interacting with subatomic particles, reducing the rays' passage through the material.

As gamma rays pass through the body, they cause ionizing damage to tissue and DNA and should be treated with caution.

### X-Rays

X-rays, widely used in healthcare, share similarities with gamma rays in their ability to penetrate tissue.

Their application in medical imaging includes plain X-ray films, CT scans, and fluoroscopy.

**Lead is effective in shielding against x-rays due to its density.**

The position of the x-ray emitting source of the the C-arm used for endovascular procedures is at the bottom of the arm, beneath the patient and the operating room table. **This is the location of highest exposure.**

As the X-ray source emits radiation, **radiation scatter occurs**, moving upward and outward from the source.

## Terminology

It is imporant to understanding the terminology related to radiation exposure.

-   The **absorbed dose** refers to the energy from ionizing radiation per unit mass of exposed material, measured in **grays (Gy).**
-   The **equivalent dose** represents the mean absorbed dose of a specific organ or tissue, measured in **sieverts (Sv).**
-   The **effective dose,** also measured in \*8sieverts (Sv),\*\* accounts for total-body radiation exposure and is guided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) guidelines for comparing radiation effects on individuals.

X-ray technology for imaging comprises two critical components: the **radiation source,** where X-ray photons are generated, and the **detector.**

-   The shape of the beam from the **source** is managed by the **collimator.**
-   As X-ray beam passes through the patient, they are captured by the detector and an image is created by **image intensifier.**

In endovascular procedures using a C-arm, the detector portion (i.e. image intensifier) is above the patient, while the X-ray source is beneath the patient and table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Principles for Patient Safety and Radiation Exposure

While any procedure that produces ionizing radiation will expose the patient to some degree of risk, it is the responsibility of the patient's surgeon to ensure that the risk of the procedure is minimized as much as possible without compromising the efficacy of the therapy.

Certain considerations exist for special patient populations including pregnant patients. These are discussed later in this chapter.

A number of core principles should be considered whenever a provider is considering recommending or performing a treatment with ionizing radiation including:

### Medical Necessity and Justification for the Procedure

The potential benefits of the procedure should outweigh the risks of not performing the procedure or performing an alternative procedure without radiation exposure.

### Exposure Optimization

The radiation dose delivered, particularly for intraoperative exposures, should be optimized to be as low as possible while still achieving adequate image quality for the procedure and decision making.

This includes fluoroscopy techniques such as reducing the time under fluoroscopy by using **pulsed fluoroscopy** as opposed to continuous scanning, **collimating the X-ray beam** to the area of interest and **narrowing the beam** to only scan structures necessary, **adjusting the frame rate of fluoroscopy** images when temporal resolution is not necessary.

It also includes **effective preoperative planning,** including properly positioning the patient for optimal imaging to reduce repeated attempts, and planning with previous imaging to ensure good understanding of the vascular anatomy and to form a procedural plan prior to exposing the patient to additional radiation.

### The ALARA Principles

ALARA stands for *"As Low As Reasonably Possible,"* and refers to the balance between minimizing radiation exposure to the patient without compromising the quality of care.

**The energy of the X-rays:** Higher energy X-rays will have greater penetrance and pass through thicker and deeper tissue more easily. Energy is typically adjusted during the procedure to optimize for the depth of the structures being imaged.

**The duration of exposure:** The dose of radiation delivered to the patient and the OR staff is directly correlated with the duration of exposure. This is why vascular surgeons try to limit the amount of time under fluoroscopy to the minimum required.

**The distance from the source:** The intensity of radiation exposure decreases with distance from the emitting source in an inverse square relationship. The patient and surgeons at bedside and closest to the C-arm, therefore, receive significantly greater doses of radiation as compared to OR staff further away.

### Patient Education and Informed Consent:

Patients should be informed about the risks of exposure to ionizing radiation, the benefits of the procedure, and the efforts made to reduce total dosage.

Patients should provide informed consent before any intervention whenever possible, and should be encouraged to ask questions and voice concerns prior to the initiation of treatment.

### Patient monitoring and dose recording:

During fluoroscopy-guided procedures, patient radiation doses should be monitored and recorded accurately to help understand the patient's cumulative radiation exposure.

In a hybrid OR, the total radiation is recorded on the large screen. If not, you can always ask the hybrid room technician.

### Radiation shielding:

The use of personal protective devices made of dense materials, such as lead aprons, thyroid collars, and other protective shields, serve to attenuate radiation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Shielding

Shielding serves to protect vital organs from radiation exposure and damage. The most common type of shielding is lead, typically in the form of a skirt, vest, and thyroid shield worn beneath the surgical gown.

Lead aprons and other lead-lined materials are highly effective in protecting personnel from radiation exposure. Lead, being a very dense material, absorbs a significant portion of the radiation from X-ray beams that would otherwise reach the person wearing it. These lead protection devices are specifically designed to safeguard vital organs and those most sensitive to radiation exposure---such as organs not shielded by overlying bone. This includes the torso, reproductive organs, and the thyroid gland.

Reported effectiveness of worn lead varies. Some sources claim that a lead apron with a thickness of 0.5 mm can reduce radiation scatter by 90%, while others suggest a lesser reduction. However, there is a consensus that the apron should be at least 0.25 mm thick both in the front and back. [@cheon2018]

Additional shielding such as lead screens can be found in the OR to provide further protection against scattered X-rays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Radiation Badges

Radiation badges or "dosimeters" are personal wearable devices designed to measure the amount of radiation exposure an individual receives. They measure the total exposure accumulated over a set period of time. It's important to note that these devices specifically measure ionizing radiation and not other forms.

There are several types of badges available. Film badges are commonly used in clinical practice. They are worn by a single person and are evaluated every 30 days. Other types of badges provide real-time quantification of radiation exposure, with readings recorded at the beginning and end of each shift. A radiation officer is typically tasked with tracking these exposure levels.

When an individual's exposure approaches a certain threshold, which is typically set below the maximum allowable dose for a year, measures are taken to further minimize their exposure. For instance, if an employee has reached a significant exposure level two months into the year, the radiation compliance officer would discuss strategies to reduce their exposure. Strategies include maintaining greater distance from radiation sources, rotating through cases more frequently, and avoiding involvement in procedures with a higher risk of elevated radiation levels.

If an employee surpasses their annual exposure limits, they are typically prohibited from participating in procedures involving radiation for the remainder of the year. The specific limits of exposure are detailed later in the chapter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lead Glasses and Eye Protection

In the endovascular suite, it's common to see individuals wearing leaded glasses. A 2016 study compared different types of glasses and their effectiveness in reducing radiation exposure. The results showed that all leaded glasses outperformed non-leaded safety glasses, with an average reduction in dose of approximately **90.3%**. [@waddell2016] This study is just one of many that highlight the efficacy of lead glasses in minimizing eye exposure during procedures involving radiation.

Despite the significant reduction achieved with the use of **lead safety glasses**, there's a caveat regarding a false sense of security. Due to the scattering of radiation during procedures, the eye can be exposed to radiation at oblique angles (i.e. around the glasses), leading to increased exposure and limited reduction in dose. [@kirkwood2020] In such scenarios, the optimal solution for reducing eye exposure would be a **full visor or face shield with lateral eye shielding**. A study by Samara et al. demonstrated that the most substantial dose reduction was observed in the full visor group.[@samara2022]

**Wearing lead safety glasses during interventions is recommended** as it reduces radiation exposure and helps maintain eye health, particularly for individuals at risk of accumulating significant lifetime radiation exposure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Imaging Technique

Now that we've covered both radiation equipment and safety gear, it's crucial to underscore the importance of imaging technique. This concept is critical because it addresses the multifaceted aspects of minimizing radiation exposure during procedures. 

The radiation dose depends on both the **intensity of imaging** and the **duration of fluoroscopic exposure**. [@rial2021] During endovascular procedures, the operating surgeon can control these factors by:

1.  **Pulse imaging**: Instead of continuously scanning the patient, the surgeon can pulsate images (i.e. shoot several plain x-rays). This approach reduces scatter and lowers overall exposure. It\'s especially effective when high temporal resolution isn\'t necessary.

2.  **Collimator use**: The surgeon can use the collimator to narrow the X-ray beam, focusing solely on the area of interest. This method effectively reduces both dose and scatter.

The image intensifier should be positioned closer to the patient to optimize image quality. Conversely, the X-ray tube should be placed further away from the area being imaged. 

If the X-ray tube is too close, imaging quality can degrade and radiation dose increases. This strategic arrangement ensures that the image quality remains high while minimizing patient exposure to radiation.

:::

Another crucial aspect of radiation exposure is a person\'s **distance from the radiation source**. Radiation exposure decreases as the distance from the source increases. This phenomenon follows an **inverse square law (1/d\^2)**. [@kim2018]

::: callout-note
Suppose a medical student is initially **one foot away** from a radiation source, and their exposure is measured at **500 mGy/min**. If they then move **ten feet away f**rom the source, their exposure would reduce significantly to **5 mGy/min**. This example vividly demonstrates why distance from the source plays a pivotal role in minimizing radiation exposure.

:::

::: callout-tip
If you are not scrubbed, the ideal place to stand is as far away from the x-ray source while making sure you can still see the images and interact with the surgical team.
:::

When discussing the positioning of the C-arm, it's useful to become familiar with some common terminology. To improve visualization of the target area, the C-arm can rotate left and right, and cranially or caudally. **All terminology is relative to the radiation source (under the table) and not the intensifier (above the patient).** Two frequently encountered positions are **RAO (right anterior oblique)** and **LAO (left anterior oblique).**

## Pregnant Populations 

Vascular surgeons perform a number of endovascular procedures. The most common include placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, diagnostic angiograms with angioplasty and stenting, fistulagrams, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and thrombectomy and thrombolysis. There are a number of basics that trainees should know before starting one of these procedures.

### IVC Filter Placement

-   An IVC Filter is a metal cage-like device placed in the IVC to prevent clots from embolizing to the pulmonary vasculature.
-   The hook at the superior aspect of the filter is used to aid with retrieval.
-   The struts will catch clots and will anchor into the walls of the IVC to prevent migration.
-   **Placement of an IVC filter can be controversial** but it is commonly used to prevent pulmonary embolism in patients who have a strict contraindication to anticoagulation.
-   They are sometimes placed prophylactically in high-risk trauma patients.

![Inferior Vena Cava Filter courtesy of scientificanimations.com. Retrieved on 30 March. Wikimedia.](images/ivcfilter.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

Procedure:

-   Access is usually obtained via the right femoral vein as it gives direct access to the IVC.

-   Ultrasound should be used to confirm that there is no thrombus at the access site - Access is then obtained via the Seldinger technique and a venacavogram is then obtained to assess the anatomy and the location of the renal veins

-   The filter is generally placed just below the renal veins to prevent renal vein thrombus if filter thrombosis occurs.

-   If a retrievable filter is placed, it should be removed as soon as the filter is no longer clinically indicated.

-   Filter retrieval becomes more challenging the longer the filter remains in place.

-   Filter retrieval is generally performed through the internal jugular vein in the neck to give access to the hook at the superior end of the filter, which can be snared and removed.

### Lower Extremity Angiogram

A lower extremity angiogram is the starting point for a vascular surgeon to perform a number of different interventions including angioplasty, stenting, and thrombectomy. An angiogram is a procedure in which contrast dye is used to display the vasculature and its disease burden under X-ray.

::: callout-tip
Before an angiogram, one should be aware of all prior interventions a patient has had, both open and endovascular. It can be useful to review old operative reports and imaging studies in order to know the patient's current anatomy.
:::

::: callout-tip
In addition, the patient's most recent imaging studies should be reviewed including ABI/PVRs, arterial duplex, and any axial imaging such as a CTA.

Please see Claudication Chapter for a summary of ABI/PVR testing and interpretation.
:::

Procedure:

-   Access is typically obtained in the contralateral common femoral artery and a wire and catheter are passed up and over the aortic bifurcation to gain access to the operative (ipsilateral) side.

-   A series of angiograms are taken to assess the level of disease and based on this a final operative plan will be made.

-   There are multiple options for treatment including angioplasty, stenting, atherectomy, thrombectomy, and thrombolysis, to name a few.

Possible Interventions:

-   **Angioplasty:** a balloon is advanced across the area of concern (usually atherosclerosis causing a flow limitation) and expanded to dilate the area of stenosis.

-   **Stenting:** commonly after an angioplasty, a stent is placed to maintain patency of the area. There are multiple types of stents (covered above) that can be used depending on anatomic location, size, and indication.

-   **Atherectomy:** a procedure where a calcified plaque is physically removed from the artery. This can be done with a cutting blade, a spinning drill-like device, or a laser.

::: callout-note
**Considerations for Atherectomy**

As plaque is broken into smaller pieces, there is a significant risk for **distal embolization** of plaque debris. To prevent this, an embolic protection device is often used which can filter blood and catch any smaller particulate matter that travels distally. Some of the devices include an aspiration device to remove clot and thrombus as it is removed.

There is ongoing research into the outcomes of atherectomy versus stenting alone, but generally, the long-term patency rate is similar.[@atherect]
:::

-   **Thrombolysis:** a procedure where the clot is dissolved often with tPA and heparin to treat an acute thrombotic event. Often, angiograms are performed for acute limb ischemia from a clot rather than atherosclerotic disease. A lysis catheter or Cragg-Macnamara catheter can be placed. The **Cragg-Macnamara catheter** is a long catheter with multiple side ports where medication can be infused over the length of a thrombosed artery. This catheter can be left in place for **24-48 hours** and the medication is allowed to "bust" the acute clot. After this, the patient will be brought back to the operating room to evaluate the progress of the clot dissolution.[@giannakakis2017]

-   **Thrombectomy:** a procedure where acute or subacute thrombus is removed from a vessel. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Commonly, a suction thrombectomy system can be used to remove thrombus from a vessel using vacuum force for example using the **Penumbra system.** Alternatively, a mechanical thrombectomy can be performed where a Fogarty catheter is deployed past a thrombus, a balloon inflated at the end of the catheter, and then manually pulled back towards an arteriotomy and the clot then removed.[@karnabatidis2011]

### Fistulograms

A fistulogram is an angiographic study used to interrogate and troubleshoot a disfunctional arteriovenous fistula.

Common complications of fistulas include:

-   Anastomotic strictures.
-   Inflow issues (such as atherosclerosis of the inflow artery).
-   Outflow issues (such as central venous stenosis).
-   Thrombosed fistula.

Access is obtained in different locations depending on the culprit lesions (the inflow artery, the fistula itself, the outflow veins) and can be treated with angioplasty and or stenting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Risks

As with any invasive procedure, even a minimally invasive procedure comes with its own set of risks, and as the complexity of the procedure increases so does the risk.

The American Heart Association has put out guidelines to help stratify patients at risk for vascular complications.[@patel2010a]

**Low risk cases** were defined as those with a complication rate below 1%. Characteristics include:

-   Diagnostic angiograms without interventions.
-   Short operative times.
-   Small sheaths (5 Fr).
-   Minimal anticoagulation.
-   Younger male patients with larger body habitus and normal renal function were at lowest risk of complications.

**Moderate risk cases** were defined as those with a complication rate of 1-3%. Risk factors include:

-   Longer, more complex procedures.
-   Involve larger sheaths (6-7Fr).

**High risk cases** were defined as those with a complication rate \>3%. Risk factors include:

-   Peripheral arterial disease patients
-   Advanced age
-   Female sex at birth
-   Liver disease
-   Coagulopathy
-   Immunosuppression
-   Status post valve replacement
-   Renal dysfunction.
-   Longer procedure times
-   Larger sheaths (\>8Fr), use of arterial closure devices
-   More likely to involve anticoagulation

### Access Complications

Although each procedure comes with its own specific risks (e.g. stroke for a carotid artery stent, distal embolization for atherectomy etc), there are multiple complications that can occur with any endovascular procedure. The procedure specific complications will be explored in further detail in each chapter. Common access complications are listed below.

#### Groin Hematoma

A groin hematoma is a collection of blood that has collected outside the lumen of the vessel, which often occurs after removal of the sheath.

Groin hematoma characteristics:

-   Occur in about 1-3 % of cases
-   Often due to a stick not directly over the femoral head in which case manual pressure may not provide adequate hemostasis.
-   Hematomas are rarely ever operated on unless they case skin compromise, severe pain, femoral nerve compression, or are rapidly expanding.
-   Hematoma will generally be absorbed by the body.
-   If they are operated on, there is a significant risk of infection (about 20%) and seroma formation.

#### Pseudoaneurysms

A pseudoaneurysm is defined as a collection of turbulent blood flow contained only by one or two layers of the arterial wall as opposed to a true aneurysm where all three layers are dilated (**occur in less than 1% of endovascular cases**). They occur secondary to injury (iatrogenic or trauma).

**These must be managed urgently and treated appropriately to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.**

##### Pseudoaneurysm presentation:

-   Pulsatile often painful mass at a prior access site
-   May lead to skin necrosis
-   Bruit on auscultation

##### Pseudoaneurysm risks:

-   Vessel rupture
-   Thrombus formation with distal embolization
-   Skin necrosis
-   Nerve compression
-   Venous compression

##### Etiology:

Most often, seen at the femoral artery as an access site complication from:

-   Failed deployment of a closure device
-   Laceration of the artery or branch by an access needle
-   Inadequate pressure or length of pressure being held.

Patients who are obese, female, hypertensive or are on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy are at higher risk for femoral PSA.

##### Workup:

-   Duplex ultrasound of the site.
-   Pulse exam to ensure adequate distal perfusion.

##### Management:

Management is dependent on size and presentation of the pseudoaneurysm. In the past, all pseudoaneurysms were treated operatively, but with new advances, minimally invasive techniques have become more common with good outcomes.

-   For a small asymptomatic pseudoaneurysm (less than 2cm), an appropriate first step would be observation and repeat duplex ultrasound in about one month.
-   For a persistent pseudoaneurysm after one month, a larger/loculated asymptomatic pseudoaneurysm, or a pseudoaneurysm that presents with minor pain at the site, minimally invasive intervention with ultrasound guided compression or ultrasound guided thrombin injection is appropriate.
-   For any pseudoaneurysm presenting with persistent hemodynamic instability, limb ischemia, skin necrosis, AV fistula, nerve compression, expanding hematoma, an urgent operation is required.
-   Urgent open repair generally consists of gaining proximal and distal control and then primary repair of the arterial defect.
-   Urgent endovascular management may also be entailed by deploying coils in the sac and placing a covered stent in the femoral artery, therefore thrombosing the pseudoaneurysm.

#### Retroperitoneal Hematoma

A retroperitoneal hematoma is a collection of blood accumulating in the retroperitoneal space where the external iliac artery travels.

Key points:

-   It is a rare complication occurring in about 0.5% of cases.
-   Retroperitonaly hematomas are a dreaded complication as they comes with high morbidity and mortality especially if not rapidly diagnosed.
-   Retroperitoneal hematomas occur when the arterial stick in the artery during groin puncture is performed too high, above the level of the inferior epigastric artery.
-   This leads to extravasation of blood into the retroperitoneal space after sheath removal.
-   Retroperitoneal hematomas can usually can be treated with a closure device if diagnosed intra operatively or a covered stent from the contralateral side.

#### Arteriovenous (AV) Fistula

An arteriovenous fistula is an aberrant connection between an artery and a vein. Although commonly formed surgically for hemodialysis access, they can be caused iatrogenically during arterial access for endovascular intervention.

Key points:

-   They are rare and occur in less than 1% of groin access cases.
-   Occur during inadvertent puncture of the deep femoral artery and deep femoral vein.
-   Usually no intervention is needed.

#### Dissection

An arterial dissection is the separation of the layers of the arterial wall.

Key points:

-   May occur naturally (often secondary to hypertension) or iatrogenically (in the setting of arterial puncture). This most often occurs in the setting of a posteriorly lying plaque in the artery where the wire can separate the posterior layers.
-   To prevent dissection, do not apply too much forward pressure when advancing a wire during initial arterial access. Do not inject fluid (saline or contrast) unless there is blood return to ensure the needle or catheter tip are in the true lumen.
-   Treatment can be conservative in the case of an iatrogenic dissection or treated with stent placement if the dissection limits blood flow. Intravascular ultrasound can be used to further assess the dissection.

#### Acute Thrombosis of Access Vessel

Acute thrombus of the access vessel is when the artery where access is obtained completely "clots off." It is an incredibly rare complication caused by incorrect deployment of vascular closure devices, access site dissection, or occlusive sheath placement in a small or diseased vessel.

### Endovascular Surgical Complications

#### Atheroembolism

Atheroembolism is the dislodgement of a portion of a cholesterol plaque leading to distal embolization causing acute thrombosis or partial occlusion.

Key points: [@liew2005]

-   Generally, when these come from the ascending aorta or arch, they will embolize to the cerebral and retinal vessels. On the other hand, when an embolus originates in the thoracic or descending aorta, it will likely embolize to the mesenteric, renal or lower extremity vessels.
-   These emboli will then cause a further inflammatory response worsening outcomes.
-   Outcomes are dependent on volume and size of emboli and can range from sub-clinical to fatal.
-   Embolization is most common to the skin, kidneys, and GI tract though it is dependent on the site of the procedure.
-   Unfortunately this condition is generally under diagnosed and challenging to treat. - Primary prevention is of utmost importance with good surgical technique.

#### Wire Perforation

Wire perforation occurs when an angiographic wire creates a hole in a vessel.

Key points:

-   Incredibly rare but treatable when diagnosed rapidly.
-   Occurs when a large stiff hydrophilic wire is passed through a small vessel especially if not done under fluoroscopic guidance.
-   Treatment involves transcatheter embolization of the perforation site.

#### Vessel Rupture

Vessel rupture occurs when a device or balloon is oversized for a vessel and causes a "blowout" of a vessel.

Key points:

-   Rupture can be cause by an oversized balloon or balloon expandable stent, by expanding a properly sized balloon in a heavily calcified vessel or by passage of a large device such as an EVAR device through a small vessel.
-   Rupture is associated with a high morbidity and mortality especially if there is any delay in diagnosis.
-   Immediately upon recognition of vessel rupture, a balloon should be inflated in the region to obtain adequate hemostasis. Simultaneously, supplies should be can gathered for vessel repair.
-   Repair is usually done with a covered stent placed across the rupture. If adequate hemostasis cannot be obtained, open repair may be necessary.

## Teaching Case

### Scenario

A 71 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease with stent placement was diagnosed with acute type B aortic dissection three weeks ago. He was managed medically in the hospital and sent home after one week with blood pressure and pain well-controlled. An image from the CTA at time of diagnosis is seen below:

![CTA](images/endotc.jpg){fig-align="left" width="80%"}

The proximal extent of the dissection was 3 cm distal to the left subclavian artery and the distal extent was 2 cm superior to the celiac artery, allowing good landing zones for an endograft. The left internal iliac artery is fully occluded, and the right internal iliac artery has roughly 50% stenosis. The left external iliac artery is heavily calcified and stenotic \>50%. The right common and external iliac artery are patent without evidence of significant atherosclerosis. The patient is evaluated in the preoperative area prior to placement of a thoracic endograft in the hybrid operating room.

### Exam

**HEENT:** Pupils round and reactive to light, no lymphadenopathy

**Cardiac:** Regular rate and rhythm

**Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation in all lung fields. No accessory muscle use.

**Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no pulsatile masses felt.

**Vascular/Extremities:** Warm, non-edematous. Palpable pulses in all four extremities.

### Discussion Points

::: callout-note
## N.B. There is no prepared answers for the questions below.

However, we feel this chapter contains all the necessary information to answer the questions. If not, please let us know!
:::

1.  What clinical risk factors make this patient a good candidate for endovascular vs. open repair?
2.  The endograft used for this operation requires at least an 18F sheath, which site of access should be used to insert and implant the graft?
3.  What diameter and hydrophilicity of wire should be used to advance the thoracic endograft to the site of dissection?
4.  The attending surgeon requested mean arterial pressures to be at least 90 mmHg throughout the operation. Why would intraoperative hypotension be concerning in this patient? What anatomic factors make this patient at particular risk?
5.  If the patient developed pain at the site of access one week later, with a well-healing wound and palpable thrill on physical exam, what kind of access-related complication are you worried about and what would be your next step to confirm the diagnosis?
