## Case of the Week

To harness the learning principles of [spaced practice](https://www.learningscientists.org/spaced-practice), [retrieval practice](https://www.learningscientists.org/retrieval-practice), [interleaving](https://www.learningscientists.org/interleaving) and [concrete examples](https://www.learningscientists.org/concrete-examples), we invite students and residents to write a case of the week and submit it to APDVS for review. 

Please try to build the case using material covered in the eBook. We ask you to write for the medical student level. Please include discussions to questions including why the correct is answer is correct and why the incorrect answers are incorrect. 

Once reviewed, we will post it here for the community! We hope you will take part in this mini-publication exercise!

Please submit your case to ezraschwartz@hms.harvard.edu
