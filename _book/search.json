    "text": "Pre/Post Questions\n\nA 75-year-old male smoke presents with recent visual changes to his right eye that occurred yesterday, the patient reports a shading of his visual field that resulted in momentary monocular blindness followed by return to normal vision. He has a carotid duplex showing >50% diameter reduction to his right internal carotid artery and >80% stenosis to his left internal carotid artery. What treatment should be offered to his patient?\n\nA. Emergent DC cardioversion to treat any underlying arrythmia.\nB. Left carotid endarterectomy with shunt placement.\nC. Left carotid TCAR.\nD. Right carotid endarterectomy.\nE. Placement on Apixaban and measurement of PF4 with medical management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Right carotid endarterectomy\nDiscussion: The patient has evidence of amaurosis fugax with temporary monocular blindness as a sign of symptomatic right internal carotid artery disease. His left carotid artery is in a high-grade range and therefore is lower risk of stroke than the contralateral symptomatic lesion. There should be no immediate surgical treatment of the asymptomatic left carotid lesion. There is no evidence that the patient has an underlying arrythmia that needs cardioversion and medical management with Apixaban and PF4 levels are unrelated to this patient’s current pathology.\n\n\n\n\nA 50-year-old female patient with >80% right internal carotid artery stenosis presents to clinic for her first postoperative visit after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). She has no interval neurologic events since her discharge, has a soft neck with a clean incision. During your neurologic exam you notice an unintentional, subtle tongue deviation to the side of surgery. What is the most likely facial nerve involved in this finding?\n\nA. Vagus Nerve.\nB. Hypoglossal Nerve.\nC. Glossopharyngeal Nerve.\nD. Long Thoracic Nerve.\nE. Hering’s Nerve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Hypoglossal Nerve\nDiscussion: This patient has evidence of hypoglossal nerve neuropraxia which can occur as the result of injury or traction on the nerve during distal dissection of the internal carotid artery. Although both glossopharyngeal nerve injury and vagal injuries can also occur during CEA, one causes oropharyngeal dysfunction with swallowing and the latter causes vocal cord paralysis with hoarse voice. Long thoracic nerve is more related to thoracic outlet surgery and innervation of the serratus anterior. The nerve of Hering is related to carotid sinus innervation and is unrelated to this clinical finding.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the initial evaluation of a patient with high grade symptomatic carotid disease, you notice that the patient has internal carotid plaque on that side this is above the angle of the mandible at the 1st cervical vertebral body (C1). This appears to be too high to access through open surgery. The patient has no know history of coronary artery disease, has a preserved ejection fraction and good functional status. He has a low-density lipoprotein level (LDL) of 200 mg/dL. What is the best treatment option for this individual?\n\nA. Transfemoral carotid artery angioplasty with placement on ASA only. B. Carotid artery enterectomy with shunt placement. C. Daily ASA therapy without any type of statin or antihypertensive therapy. D. Trancarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) surgery with dual antiplatelet therapy. E. No treatment is indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n**D. Transcarotid artery revascularization surgery with dual antiplatelet therapy.**\nDiscussion: This patient has symptomatic carotid stenosis with an overall optimal coronary health, based on his lesion being high at C1 and not surgically accessible, they would not qualify for a traditional carotid endarterectomy. Transfemoral carotid artery angioplasty is not indicated without stent placement, and daily ASA therapy without statin treatment for an LDL of 200mg/dL does not qualify as optimal medical management. Surgical treatment is indicated in this symptomatic patient since he has no significant cardiopulmonary disease and TCAR is the only option listed that could accomplish this outcome successfully."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nHemispheric Stroke related to carotid stenosis is a leading cause of both disability and death in the United States. Underlying etiologies for stroke include occlusive or hemorrhagic events with roughly 80% being related to occlusive pathology through embolus or in-situ thrombosis, the remaining 20% attributable to hemorrhage. Roughly 15% of stroke victims have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) that fully resolved prior to a later stroke event. Risk factors for carotid plaque formation are related to age, smoking, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and family history of stroke. Due to carotid bulb anatomy, the most common area of plaque formation is within the proximal internal carotid artery. As plaque stenosis increases over time, the systolic velocity increases to maintain flow volumes which intensifies shear stress. This shear stress increases likelihood of plaque rupture, platelet aggregation and thromboembolization. There are multiple seminal studies that describe cohort comparisons of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis with outcomes related to optimal medical management alone or as adjunct to surgical repair. Symptomatic carotid stenosis is described as carotid stenosis >50% with unilateral stroke, TIA or amaurosis fugax on the side of carotid disease. Amaurosis fugax is historically described as shade coming down across one eye on the side of stenosis to produce complete monocular visual loss related to transient retinal ischemia."

    "section": "Etiology",
    "text": "Etiology\nAtherosclerosis is the most common cause for the development of carotid artery disease. This process is defined by deposition of lipid-laden plaque at the carotid bifurcation, and potentially across a larger territory of the common carotid, external carotid, and internal carotid arteries. This plaque may contain varying degrees of calcification and/or thrombus. The mechanisms by which atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation may lead to stroke or TIA are: occlusion (cessation of blood flow to the internal carotid artery) or embolization (plaque debris break off and travel through the internal carotid artery to the brain). There are various risk factors which may contribute to the degree of atherosclerosis and its progression. These include history of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, advanced age, and family history of carotid disease or stroke."

    "section": "Diagnostics and Imaging",
    "text": "Diagnostics and Imaging\nThree primary imaging modalities are used to evaluate carotid artery stenosis with the lowest cost option being color flow duplex ultrasound (DSA) that allows a physician to determine peak systolic and end diastolic velocities throughout the carotid bifurcation. Based on the internally validated vascular laboratory criteria of the institution, these velocities can be correlated to ranges of degree of stenosis, with high grade stenosis defined as >70-80%. Since the modality is based primarily on velocity range, it cannot give exact stenosis such as 66%. The modality can also provide adjunct information about the blood flow waveforms in each arterial segment, as well as whether that flow is laminar or turbulent with utilization of color flow imaging. Limitations of this imaging include technician skill, inability to obtain optimal angle of doppler interrogation for velocity determination, shadowing from heavily calcified lesions, poor visualization due to patient habitus and tortuosity.\nAxial imaging options include both Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) and Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA). Both of these two options require some form of intra-arterial contrast either iodinated contrast or gadolinium, respectively. However, they offer a fuller perspective of relevant anatomy and a more precise determination of stenosis within the limitations of the modality, with MRA often overestimating the degree of stenosis due to intrinsic properties of MRA imaging acquisition. Both CTA and MRA, although superior to DSA in determination of exact degree of plaque stenosis and arterial anatomy, sacrifice the physiologic information offered through DSA that speak to flow patterns, flow direction and turbulence. Axial imaging of CTA and MRA can define patency but do not speak to the dynamic nature of blood flow or directionality of flow.\nDefinitive determination of flow and directionality can be augmented to a carotid artery stenosis workup by diagnostic angiography. This requires femoral artery access and includes contrast administration, as well as a small risk of periprocedural embolization. However, it offers additional physiologic evaluation that might not be present in DSA and that is inherently lacking in CTA and MRA studies."

    "section": "Treatment",
    "text": "Treatment\n\nCarotid Artery Endarterectomy (CEA)\nProcedure has been performed since the 1950s either with plaque endarterectomy with patch angioplasty or with primary arterial repair. To prevent arterial restenosis, patch angioplasty has become the standard of arterial closure after plaque removal. The procedure can involve cerebral monitoring including EEG, TCD and stump pressure monitoring or be performed awake to directly monitor patient motor response. Patch repair can be performed under a “clamp and sew” mentality or with an arterial shunt to maintain cerebral perfusion during endarterectomy and patch repair. Risks include cardiopulmonary risk of acute myocardial ischemia, <3% perioperative risk of neurologic event, neck hematoma or cranial nerve injury of roughly 5-10% affecting the vagus, marginal mandibular, recurrent laryngeal or hypoglossal nerves.\n\n\nCarotid Artery Stenting (CAS)\n\nTransfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS) with Embolic Protection\nTransfemoral stenting requires some type of protection from embolization including a distal internal carotid artery retrievable filter or flow arrest procedure to prevent cerebral embolization during stent placement with or without angioplasty.\n\n\nTranscarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)\nTreatment of a carotid stenosis that avoids aortic arch manipulation involving direct common carotid artery exposure and sheath placement to allow for transcarotid stent delivery to the internal carotid artery. The common carotid artery sheath is connected to a femoral vein sheath so that the natural arterial pressure gradient reverses flow across the distal internal carotid artery driving blood and embolus into the arterial tubing circuit and across a filter before it reenters the venous circulation. FDA approval for the device was delivered in 2016 so the technology is still less than 10 years old without robust long-term follow up. This technique offers a lower perioperative stroke risk than transfemoral stenting, for multiple reasons including lack of transaortic arch manipulation and great vessel cannulation which can result in embolus prior to placement of an internal carotid artery embolic protection device.\n\n\n\nOptimal Medical Management\nUnderstandably, optimal medical management requires full risk evaluation of the individual patient in question including other comorbidities, drug allergies, compliance, etc., we have listed a few broad recommendations to follow that offer general guidance surrounding the dynamic target of optimal medical management for arterial disease.\n\nAntiplatelet Therapy\n\nASA offers a 22% risk reduction in major vascular events with no difference in protection based on dosage (81 versus 325 mg).\nClopidogrel can be used as an adjunct or alternative to ASA, but the added benefit from dual antiplatelet combination in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is unproven.\n\n\n\nAnticoagulants\n\nOnly useful for prevention of stroke in cardioembolic strokes due to arrhythmia or prosthetic valve.\n\n\n\nHypertension Treatment\n\nRecommended blood pressure range of <130/80 with individual antihypertensive regimen based on other comorbidities and patient risk factors.\n\n\n\nDiabetic Control\n\nIn accordance with best practice for diabetes management, the patient’s hemoglobin A1c should be <7.0\n\n\n\nSmoking Cessation\n\nTreatments offered include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline or bupropion as first line agents.\n\n\n\nHyperlipidemia Management\n\nRegimen goals of LDL <100mg/dl, or <70mg/dl depending on risk profile."

    "section": "Outcomes",
    "text": "Outcomes\n\nAsymptomatic carotid stenosis\n\nThe historically touted Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) demonstrated that patients with >60% carotid stenosis who underwent CEA benefited significantly from stroke risk reduction at 5 years (5.1% for CEA vs. 11% for optimal medical therapy consisting of aspirin alone).\nMore recent contemporary studies suggest that with the current optimal medical management, which consists of antiplatelet medication and statin therapy, 5-year stroke risk is highest in patients with >70% carotid stenosis, and therefore this patient population would benefit from carotid endarterectomy.\nPatients who are deemed high risk, either due to an anatomic(such as surgically inaccessible bifurcation or restenosis after previous CEA) or physiologic finding (congestive heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), may be considered for TCAR given the equivocal results of perioperative stroke or death at 1.3%, as compared to CEA.\n\n\n\nSymptomatic carotid stenosis\n\nPatients who have >50% carotid stenosis and have developed symptoms of TIA or stroke were found to benefit from CEA in the pivotal North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) because of the significant 2-year stroke risk reduction as compared to optimal medical management (15.7% vs. 22.2%.). An even great stroke risk reduction was seen in patients with >70% carotid stenosis (9% CEA vs. 26% medical management).\nCurrent management of patients with symptomatic >50% carotid stenosis who are low/standard risk is carotid endarterectomy over transfemoral carotid stenting (TFCAS), as there are no studies to date which have shown benefit of TFCAS.\nPatients who are deemed high risk, as defined above, may be considered for TCAR over TFCAS due to the significantly lower incidence of in-hospital stroke and death (1.6% vs. 3.1%)."

There is no prepared answers for the questions below.\n\n\n\nHowever, we feel this chapter contains all the necessary information to answer the questions. If not, please let us know!\n\n\n\nCan the learner describe this event as amaurosis fugax to explain the visual event for this patient? Do they understand that this is the result of carotid plaque embolization to the retina?\nCan the learner list the specific patient risk factors that make them higher risk of this event? Can they review best medical management to optimize these risk factors?\nIs this patient asymptomatic or symptomatic based on the clinical scenario presented?\nWhat next steps should be pursued to offer effective and timely treatment to this patient? - The learner can discuss adjunct imaging such as CTA or MRA to determine anatomic characteristics of the lesions such as ulceration, vessel patency, level (accessible or high lesions), etc.\nWould surgical management could be suggested including a discussion of carotid endarterectomy, transfemoral stenting or TCAR?\nWhat medications should be started in this scenario, such as ASA, Plavix, statin medications, etc.?\nWhat are some possible relevant complications of surgical intervention, including periprocedural stroke risk?"
