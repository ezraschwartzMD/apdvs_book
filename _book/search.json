    "text": "Pre/Post Questions\n\nA 75-year-old male smoke presents with recent visual changes to his right eye that occurred yesterday, the patient reports a shading of his visual field that resulted in momentary monocular blindness followed by return to normal vision. He has a carotid duplex showing >50% diameter reduction to his right internal carotid artery and >80% stenosis to his left internal carotid artery. What treatment should be offered to his patient?\n\nA. Emergent DC cardioversion to treat any underlying arrythmia.\nB. Left carotid endarterectomy with shunt placement.\nC. Left carotid TCAR.\nD. Right carotid endarterectomy.\nE. Placement on Apixaban and measurement of PF4 with medical management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Right carotid endarterectomy\nDiscussion: The patient has evidence of amaurosis fugax with temporary monocular blindness as a sign of symptomatic right internal carotid artery disease. His left carotid artery is in a high-grade range and therefore is lower risk of stroke than the contralateral symptomatic lesion. There should be no immediate surgical treatment of the asymptomatic left carotid lesion. There is no evidence that the patient has an underlying arrythmia that needs cardioversion and medical management with Apixaban and PF4 levels are unrelated to this patient’s current pathology.\n\n\n\n\nA 50-year-old female patient with >80% right internal carotid artery stenosis presents to clinic for her first postoperative visit after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). She has no interval neurologic events since her discharge, has a soft neck with a clean incision. During your neurologic exam you notice an unintentional, subtle tongue deviation to the side of surgery. What is the most likely facial nerve involved in this finding?\n\nA. Vagus Nerve.\nB. Hypoglossal Nerve.\nC. Glossopharyngeal Nerve.\nD. Long Thoracic Nerve.\nE. Hering’s Nerve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Hypoglossal Nerve\nDiscussion: This patient has evidence of hypoglossal nerve neuropraxia which can occur as the result of injury or traction on the nerve during distal dissection of the internal carotid artery. Although both glossopharyngeal nerve injury and vagal injuries can also occur during CEA, one causes oropharyngeal dysfunction with swallowing and the latter causes vocal cord paralysis with hoarse voice. Long thoracic nerve is more related to thoracic outlet surgery and innervation of the serratus anterior. The nerve of Hering is related to carotid sinus innervation and is unrelated to this clinical finding.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the initial evaluation of a patient with high grade symptomatic carotid disease, you notice that the patient has internal carotid plaque on that side this is above the angle of the mandible at the 1st cervical vertebral body (C1). This appears to be too high to access through open surgery. The patient has no know history of coronary artery disease, has a preserved ejection fraction and good functional status. He has a low-density lipoprotein level (LDL) of 200 mg/dL. What is the best treatment option for this individual?\n\nA. Transfemoral carotid artery angioplasty with placement on ASA only.\nB. Carotid artery enterectomy with shunt placement.\nC. Daily ASA therapy without any type of statin or antihypertensive therapy.\nD. Trancarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) surgery with dual antiplatelet therapy.\nE. No treatment is indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Transcarotid artery revascularization surgery with dual antiplatelet therapy.\nDiscussion: This patient has symptomatic carotid stenosis with an overall optimal coronary health, based on his lesion being high at C1 and not surgically accessible, they would not qualify for a traditional carotid endarterectomy. Transfemoral carotid artery angioplasty is not indicated without stent placement, and daily ASA therapy without statin treatment for an LDL of 200mg/dL does not qualify as optimal medical management. Surgical treatment is indicated in this symptomatic patient since he has no significant cardiopulmonary disease and TCAR is the only option listed that could accomplish this outcome successfully.\n\n\n\n\nA 60-year-old otherwise healthy woman, with no underlying comorbidities has a right carotid artery bruit on physical examination. She is concerned that she is at risk for stroke. She denies any episodes of vision changes, upper or lower extremity deficits, or speech impairments. She currently takes 81mg of aspirin daily, along with a multivitamin. What is the next step in management for this patient?\n\n\nNo further treatment necessary.\nCarotid duplex.\nCT angiogram head and neck.\nNeurology evaluation.\nAddition of statin therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nA. No further treatment necessary.\nDiscussion: This patient has an incidental finding of a carotid bruit on physical exam, however she has no risk factors for carotid disease (such as smoking, hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history, diabetes or hypertension. Additionally she is neurologically asymptomatic. Therefore, carotid duplex, CTA, neurology evaluation, and the addition of statin therapy are not indicated. The prevalence of >75% carotid stenosis for those with a carotid bruit has been found to be very low at 1.2%.\n\n\n\n\nA 65-year-old man who is right-handed is undergoing evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). As part of his workup, a carotid duplex is performed which demonstrates a chronic right carotid occlusion and a >80% stenosis of his left carotid artery. He has no history of ocular or cerebrovascular events. He has hypercholesterolemia and well-controlled hypertension. What is the next best step for this patient?\n\n\nProceed with the CABG as planned and continue medical therapy with aspirin and statin.\nLeft carotid endarterectomy before the CABG.\nPlace the patient on dual antiplatelet therapy, in addition to statin therapy.\nLeft TCAR (transcarotid stent) after the CABG.\nPlace the patient on anticoagulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Left carotid endarterectomy before CABG.\nDiscussion: It is standard of care to assess the carotid arteries prior to performing a CABG, with the goal of minimizing the risk of perioperative stroke. This patient has asymptomatic bilateral severe carotid disease (right occlusion and left >80% stenosis), and therefore to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke current guidelines recommend carotid revascularization prior or concomitant with the CABG. The patient does carry one high risk criterion for TCAR (coronary disease requiring revascularization), however this should not be performed after the CABG. Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated in the event this patient undergoes carotid stenting, however medical management should not be the only management of his carotid disease. Lastly, anticoagulation has no role in atherosclerotic disease, such as carotid disease.\n\n\n\n\nA 55 year old woman has a past medical history of coronary artery disease s/p coronary stenting in 2019, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous smoking history of 60 pack-years. Her cardiologist sends her for a carotid duplex which demonstrates a 50-69% carotid stenosis on the left side, and mild atherosclerosis on the right side. She denies any prior signs or symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack. How should this patient’s carotid disease be managed?\n\n\nLeft carotid endarterectomy, along with aspirin/statin therapy.\nLeft transfemoral carotid stent, along with dual antiplatelet/statin therapy.\nAspirin and statin therapy only, and routine surveillance carotid duplexes.\nAspirin, statin therapy, blood pressure management, and routine surveillance carotid duplexes.\nNo further management is indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Aspirin, statin therapy, blood pressure management, and routine surveillance carotid duplexes.\nDiscussion: This patient has asymptomatic 50-69% left carotid stenosis with the associated risk factors of vascular disease which include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking history. Medical therapy needs to be employed to reduce these factors, thus a single antiplatelet, statin, and blood pressure medication are indicated. Fortunately, the patient is not a current smoker, however if she was, then smoking cessation counseling would be added to her treatment plan. Carotid revascularization is indicated only for asymptomatic carotid stenosis that is >70% based on current guidelines."

    "text": "Introduction\nHemispheric Stroke related to carotid stenosis is a leading cause of both disability and death in the United States. Underlying etiologies for stroke include occlusive or hemorrhagic events with roughly 80% being related to occlusive pathology through embolus or in-situ thrombosis, the remaining 20% attributable to hemorrhage. Roughly 15% of stroke victims have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) that fully resolved prior to a later stroke event. Risk factors for carotid plaque formation are related to age, smoking, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and family history of stroke. Due to carotid bulb anatomy, the most common area of plaque formation is within the proximal internal carotid artery. As plaque stenosis increases over time, the systolic velocity increases to maintain flow volumes which intensifies shear stress. This shear stress increases likelihood of plaque rupture, platelet aggregation and thromboembolization. There are multiple seminal studies that describe cohort comparisons of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis with outcomes related to optimal medical management alone or as adjunct to surgical repair. Symptomatic carotid stenosis is described as carotid stenosis >50% with unilateral stroke, TIA or amaurosis fugax on the side of carotid disease. Amaurosis fugax is historically described as shade coming down across one eye on the side of stenosis to produce complete monocular visual loss related to transient retinal ischemia."

    "section": "Etiology",
    "text": "Etiology\nAtherosclerosis is the most common cause for the development of carotid artery disease. This process is defined by deposition of lipid-laden plaque at the carotid bifurcation, and potentially across a larger territory of the common carotid, external carotid, and internal carotid arteries. This plaque may contain varying degrees of calcification and/or thrombus. The mechanisms by which atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation may lead to stroke or TIA are: occlusion (cessation of blood flow to the internal carotid artery) or embolization (plaque debris break off and travel through the internal carotid artery to the brain). There are various risk factors which may contribute to the degree of atherosclerosis and its progression. These include history of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, advanced age, and family history of carotid disease or stroke."

    "section": "Diagnostics and Imaging",
    "text": "Diagnostics and Imaging\nThree primary imaging modalities are used to evaluate carotid artery stenosis with the lowest cost option being color flow duplex ultrasound (DSA) that allows a physician to determine peak systolic and end diastolic velocities throughout the carotid bifurcation. Based on the internally validated vascular laboratory criteria of the institution, these velocities can be correlated to ranges of degree of stenosis, with high grade stenosis defined as >70-80%. Since the modality is based primarily on velocity range, it cannot give exact stenosis such as 66%. The modality can also provide adjunct information about the blood flow waveforms in each arterial segment, as well as whether that flow is laminar or turbulent with utilization of color flow imaging. Limitations of this imaging include technician skill, inability to obtain optimal angle of doppler interrogation for velocity determination, shadowing from heavily calcified lesions, poor visualization due to patient habitus and tortuosity.\nAxial imaging options include both Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) and Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA). Both of these two options require some form of intra-arterial contrast either iodinated contrast or gadolinium, respectively. However, they offer a fuller perspective of relevant anatomy and a more precise determination of stenosis within the limitations of the modality, with MRA often overestimating the degree of stenosis due to intrinsic properties of MRA imaging acquisition. Both CTA and MRA, although superior to DSA in determination of exact degree of plaque stenosis and arterial anatomy, sacrifice the physiologic information offered through DSA that speak to flow patterns, flow direction and turbulence. Axial imaging of CTA and MRA can define patency but do not speak to the dynamic nature of blood flow or directionality of flow.\nDefinitive determination of flow and directionality can be augmented to a carotid artery stenosis workup by diagnostic angiography. This requires femoral artery access and includes contrast administration, as well as a small risk of periprocedural embolization. However, it offers additional physiologic evaluation that might not be present in DSA and that is inherently lacking in CTA and MRA studies."

    "section": "Treatment",
    "text": "Treatment\n\nCarotid Artery Endarterectomy (CEA)\nProcedure has been performed since the 1950s either with plaque endarterectomy with patch angioplasty or with primary arterial repair. To prevent arterial restenosis, patch angioplasty has become the standard of arterial closure after plaque removal. The procedure can involve cerebral monitoring including EEG, TCD and stump pressure monitoring or be performed awake to directly monitor patient motor response. Patch repair can be performed under a “clamp and sew” mentality or with an arterial shunt to maintain cerebral perfusion during endarterectomy and patch repair. Risks include cardiopulmonary risk of acute myocardial ischemia, <3% perioperative risk of neurologic event, neck hematoma or cranial nerve injury of roughly 5-10% affecting the vagus, marginal mandibular, recurrent laryngeal or hypoglossal nerves.\n\n\nCarotid Artery Stenting (CAS)\n\nTransfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS) with Embolic Protection\nTransfemoral stenting requires some type of protection from embolization including a distal internal carotid artery retrievable filter or flow arrest procedure to prevent cerebral embolization during stent placement with or without angioplasty.\n\n\nTranscarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)\nTreatment of a carotid stenosis that avoids aortic arch manipulation involving direct common carotid artery exposure and sheath placement to allow for transcarotid stent delivery to the internal carotid artery. The common carotid artery sheath is connected to a femoral vein sheath so that the natural arterial pressure gradient reverses flow across the distal internal carotid artery driving blood and embolus into the arterial tubing circuit and across a filter before it reenters the venous circulation. FDA approval for the device was delivered in 2016 so the technology is still less than 10 years old without robust long-term follow up. This technique offers a lower perioperative stroke risk than transfemoral stenting, for multiple reasons including lack of transaortic arch manipulation and great vessel cannulation which can result in embolus prior to placement of an internal carotid artery embolic protection device.\n\n\n\nOptimal Medical Management\nUnderstandably, optimal medical management requires full risk evaluation of the individual patient in question including other comorbidities, drug allergies, compliance, etc., we have listed a few broad recommendations to follow that offer general guidance surrounding the dynamic target of optimal medical management for arterial disease.\n\nAntiplatelet Therapy\n\nASA offers a 22% risk reduction in major vascular events with no difference in protection based on dosage (81 versus 325 mg).\nClopidogrel can be used as an adjunct or alternative to ASA, but the added benefit from dual antiplatelet combination in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is unproven.\n\n\n\nAnticoagulants\n\nOnly useful for prevention of stroke in cardioembolic strokes due to arrhythmia or prosthetic valve.\n\n\n\nHypertension Treatment\n\nRecommended blood pressure range of <130/80 with individual antihypertensive regimen based on other comorbidities and patient risk factors.\n\n\n\nDiabetic Control\n\nIn accordance with best practice for diabetes management, the patient’s hemoglobin A1c should be <7.0\n\n\n\nSmoking Cessation\n\nTreatments offered include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline or bupropion as first line agents.\n\n\n\nHyperlipidemia Management\n\nRegimen goals of LDL <100mg/dl, or <70mg/dl depending on risk profile."

    "section": "Outcomes",
    "text": "Outcomes\n\nAsymptomatic carotid stenosis\n\nThe historically touted Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) demonstrated that patients with >60% carotid stenosis who underwent CEA benefited significantly from stroke risk reduction at 5 years (5.1% for CEA vs. 11% for optimal medical therapy consisting of aspirin alone).\nMore recent contemporary studies suggest that with the current optimal medical management, which consists of antiplatelet medication and statin therapy, 5-year stroke risk is highest in patients with >70% carotid stenosis, and therefore this patient population would benefit from carotid endarterectomy.\nPatients who are deemed high risk, either due to an anatomic(such as surgically inaccessible bifurcation or restenosis after previous CEA) or physiologic finding (congestive heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), may be considered for TCAR given the equivocal results of perioperative stroke or death at 1.3%, as compared to CEA.\n\n\n\nSymptomatic carotid stenosis\n\nPatients who have >50% carotid stenosis and have developed symptoms of TIA or stroke were found to benefit from CEA in the pivotal North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) because of the significant 2-year stroke risk reduction as compared to optimal medical management (15.7% vs. 22.2%.). An even great stroke risk reduction was seen in patients with >70% carotid stenosis (9% CEA vs. 26% medical management).\nCurrent management of patients with symptomatic >50% carotid stenosis who are low/standard risk is carotid endarterectomy over transfemoral carotid stenting (TFCAS), as there are no studies to date which have shown benefit of TFCAS.\nPatients who are deemed high risk, as defined above, may be considered for TCAR over TFCAS due to the significantly lower incidence of in-hospital stroke and death (1.6% vs. 3.1%)."

    "text": "Introduction\nIf you pay close attention to the patient, “the patient will tell you what is wrong.” Specialized testing should always be guided by the initial clinical impressions.\nThough the electronic medical record helps eliminate repetitive questions and tests, it tends to divert attention from the importance of talking to and examining the patient. Interacting with the patient and family during the history and physical is extremely important to build rapport with the patients and their family.\nFor vascular patients passing the “eyeball test” is important before discussing complex procedures. This includes knowing the level of independent living."

    "text": "Patient History of the Arterial System\nAs a vascular specialist, a focused arterial history should include the arteries of the neck, torso, and extremities. Many diseases are systemic. For example, atherosclerotic disease affects the carotids, heart, upper extremities, abdominal blood vessels, and lower extremities. Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm may have synchronous peripheral aneurysms.\n\nHead and Neck History:\n\nThe history should focus on the carotid artery disease—see Chapter 3 for more detail—specifically, any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks ( TIA), or amaurosis fugax.\nAmaurosis fugax is described as a curtain or shade causing transient monocular blindness. This is usually caused by emboli from the carotid disease on the ipsilateral side but may be caused by other embolic sources, migraine, and giant cell arteritis.\nSyncopal episodes are usually not vascular in nature. However, in patients with subclavian stenosis may be a manifestation of subclavian steal syndrome.\nHistory of carotid interventions and studies should be elucidated and obtained.\n\n\n\nUpper Extremity History:\n\nThe evaluation depends on the timing (acute vs. chronic) and then the degree of ischemia (claudication vs. chronic limb-threatening ischemia) .\nAcute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden occlusion of the blood supply with no time for collateral vessels to develop. It is characterized by the 6 Ps. Pulselessness, pain, pallor, paresthesia, poikilothermia (cold), and paralysis. The most common etiology of acute limb ischemia is embolic. However, uncommon causes may be thrombosis of a subclavian–axillary aneurysm.\nIntermittent hand coldness associated with pain, numbness may reflect Raynaud’s syndrome (associated with cold exposure) or small vessel vasospasm like frostbite or scleroderma.\nRaynaud phenomena present as episodes of vasospasm in response to cold or stress. The patient describes the affected areas turning white, blue, and red during an attack. It is associated with feeling cold and numb. As the circulation improves and the affected areas turn red, there is throbbing, tingling, and swelling.\nEpisodes of ischemia to the digits may be persistent and severe and associated with underlying obliterative microangiopathy and manifest with pain, tissue loss (ulceration or gangrene).\nChronic ischemia of the upper extremity is uncommon can manifest with arm claudication (exertional fatigue). The etiology is most commonly proximal obstruction due to atherosclerotic disease in the subclavian artery. More uncommon causes are Takayasu arteritis and thoracic outlet syndrome.\n\nExertion of the arm causing posterior cerebral circulation symptoms (diplopia, dysarthria, dizziness, drop attacks, vertigo, syncope, and ataxia) may reflect a subclavian steal syndrome caused by subclavian artery stenosis proximal to the vertebral artery.\n\n\n\nAbdomen History:\n\nAneurysm disease in the abdomen is usually silent.\nWith weight loss and sitophobia (food fear), postprandial pain may reflect mesenteric artery stenosis.\nSevere hypertension, especially in young adults, may reflect renal artery stenosis.\n\nAortoiliac occlusive disease may present with Leriche’s syndrome. Leriche’s syndrome is defined as bilateral hip and buttock claudication, absent femoral pulses, and impotence.\n\nAcute abdominal pain has multiple nonvascular etiologies. A ruptured aneurysm presents severe pain radiating to the back with a pulsatile abdominal mass. Acute mesenteric ischemia manifests as pain out of proportion to the physical exam.\n\n\n\nLower Extremities History:\n\nThe evaluation depends on the timing (acute vs. chronic) and then the degree of ischemia (claudication vs. chronic limb-threatening ischemia).\nAcute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden occlusion of the blood supply with no time for collateral vessels to develop. It is characterized by the 6 Ps. Pulselessness, pain, pallor, paresthesia, poikilothermia (cold), and paralysis.\nChronic limb ischemia is frequently asymptomatic and diagnosed on physical exam or vascular lab testing. In asymptomatic disease related to atherosclerotic disease, medical therapy is initiated to prevent disease progression.\nClaudication is defined by cramping pain in the leg induced by exercise and relieved by rest. It occurs at a fixed and reproducible distance and resolves with rest. The pain is described as discomfort, cramp, numbness, or tiredness in the legs. Claudication most commonly occurs in the calf muscles, but it can also affect the feet, thighs, hips, buttocks. It is crucial to determine how the patient’s lifestyle is affected when taking a history. With proper medical therapy, including medication and exercise, claudication improves> 50% of the time. Fewer than 5% progress to amputation. Amputation is more frequent in patients who continue to smoke, have uncontrolled diabetes, and have renal failure. Differential diagnosis of claudication is in Table 1 below. Table 1 is also helpful in differentiating between other types of leg pain, pseudo claudication, and true claudication.\n\nChronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). These patients have multiple levels of arterial disease and are at risk of amputation. CLTI manifests as rest pain or tissue loss. Rest pain is characterized as pain in the dorsum of the foot and toes. It is increased with leg elevation and may wake the patient up at night and is relieved by dangling the limb, which increases perfusion by enlisting gravity to help perfuse the leg. Tissue loss can be in the form of an ulcer or gangrene."

    "text": "Physical Exam of the Arterial System\nThe arterial system is diffuse. Therefore, the evaluation of vascular patients should include the entire arterial system.\nThe exam starts with the nurse checking the vital signs and bilateral upper extremity blood pressures. A difference of > 10 mmHg between the upper extremities indicates significant hemodynamic stenosis. Most of these stenoses are asymptomatic because of the extensive collateral network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Notes\n\n\n\nArterial Bruit: Normal arterial flow is silent. However, turbulence can be heard (bruit) or palpated (thrill). Although murmur and bruit are synonymous, audible turbulence originating from the heart is called a murmur. Outside of the heart, audible turbulence is referred to as a bruit. The presence of a bruit does not necessarily indicate significant arterial stenosis.\nPulses are described as:\n\n\n0 or absent\n1+ or diminished\n2+ or normal\n3+ or prominent or aneurysmal.\n\nIn patients with weak pulses, the examiner must take care not confuse the patient’s pulse with involuntary muscle twitches or their own pulse.\nWhen a pulse is not palpated, a (portable) Doppler ultrasound probe is used to assess the blood flow. The Doppler signal can be triphasic, or biphasic, or monophasic.\nDoppler Signals:\n\nTriphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood flow.\n\nMonophasic signal correlates with moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood flow.\n\nIn severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.\nListen to examples here.\nOn Exam:\n\nTemperature changes may help demarcate the level of disease.\n\nSensory loss may be present in acute ischemia and chronic neuropathy.\n\n\n\n\nHead and Neck Exam:\n\nInspection:\n\nPulsatile masses in the neck are usually tortuous carotid arteries mistaken for carotid aneurysms. Carotid aneurysms are usually near the carotid bifurcation, while tortuous carotid arteries are usually at the base of the neck. Carotid body tumors are also at the carotid bifurcation. Both carotid body tumors and aneurysms are not visible until they are large.\nIf the patient complains of amaurosis fugax, fundoscopy may reveal cholesterol plaques called Hollenhorst plaques. These are thought to originate from the carotid plaque.\n\n\n\nPalpation:\n\nThe carotid pulse is palpated on the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Carotid palpation is generally not performed routinely as it may cause a syncopal episode in elderly patients with sensitive carotid bulbs.\nA robust temporal pulse anterior to the ear is a sign of a patent common and external carotid artery sign.\nA large supraclavicular pulse may indicate an enlarged subclavian artery. Otherwise, the subclavian artery is usually not palpable.\n\n\n\nAuscultation:\n\nInclude auscultation of the carotids for any bruits.\nUsing the stethoscope bell, you can hear the S1, and S2 heart sounds in the carotid artery in the mid-neck. A bruit heard in the neck is not normal. This could be transmitted from the heart or could be from a kink or narrowing in the carotid artery. The carotid bruit is loudest in the mid neck over the carotid bifurcation. The heart bruit (called murmur) is the loudest in the upper chest.\nThe intensity of the bruit and pitch do not correlate with the severity of stenosis. A tight stenosis may have low flow and thus a faint bruit.\nWhen a carotid bruit is heard, only 25% will have significant stenosis ( 75% or greater), and 50% will not have any stenosis.\n\n\n\n\nUpper Extremity Exam:\n\nInspection\n\nPink fingertips with capillary refill times < 2 seconds are a reliable sign of adequate perfusion. Ischemia manifests with pale extremity with poor to no capillary refill. Chronic ischemia manifests with muscle atrophy.\nRaynaud phenomenon is characterized by sharply demarcated triphasic color change after exposure to cold or emotional stress. First, the capillaries contract after the stressor, causing a characteristic white appearance. Then, as the capillaries open a little, the blood re-perfuses sluggishly and is deoxygenated; this causes a hypoxic blue color. Finally, when the capillaries recover and hyper-dilate, the affected limb becomes red and hyperemic. Raynaud’s phenomena may occur idiopathically (Raynaud’s Disease) or secondarily in autoimmune disease and is often provoked by exposure to cold or emotional distress.\n\n\n\nPalpation\n\nPalpate the axillary artery in the upper arm in the groove between the biceps and triceps muscle.\nPalpate the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa just medial to the biceps tendon\nPalpate the radial artery on the wrist’s flexor surface just medial to the radial styloid.\nPalpate the ulnar artery on the wrist’s flexor surface just medial to the distal ulna; it lies deeper than the radial artery and may not be palpable.\nAbsent pulses should initiate a search for a cause such as proximal atherosclerotic stenosis in older adults or autoimmune disease such as Takayasu’s in young females.\nAneurysm of the Subclavian artery and axillary artery (assessed above and below the clavicle) are difficult to palpate if small. Brachial artery aneurysms are usually pseudoaneurysms from trauma or arterial access. Ulnare artery aneurysm occurs from repetitive trauma in proximity to the hamate bone and manifests as hypothenar hammer syndrome.\n\n\n\nAuscultation\n\nListen for a bruit in the supraclavicular fossa over the subclavian artery.\nWhen pulses are not palpable, a Doppler is used to assess blood flow in the arteries.\nA blood pressure difference > 10 mmHg reflects hemodynamically significant stenosis in the innominate, subclavian, or axillary arteries. Therefore, the higher blood pressure is reflective of the actual blood pressure.\n\n\n\n\nChest and Abdominal Exam:\n\nInspection\n\nThe aorta usually is not visible on the exam. However, a large aneurysm may be seen pulsating between the xiphoid and umbilicus, especially in thin patients.\n\n\n\nPalpation\n\nThe aorta bifurcates at the level of the umbilicus. To palpate the aorta, press our fingers on both sides of the midline between the umbilicus and the xiphoid. The patient should bend, his knees flex his hips, and relax his abdominal muscle helps. The goal is not only to feel the aortic pulse but also to estimate the size of the aorta. In most normal thin people, the aorta is palpable and is the size of the patient’s thumb. A tender pulsatile aortic mass may represent a symptomatic aortic aneurysm or inflammatory aneurysm.\nThe sensitivity of palpation to detect an abdominal aortic aneurysm is low (29%) for small (3.0- 4cm) aneurysms. Moreover, even larger aneurysms may not be detected on physical exam (76%) for aneurysms > 5 cm. false positives can be found in elderly patients who have tortuous anterior placed aorta. It is important to mention that palpation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is safe and has never been reported to precipitate aortic rupture. When an aortic aneurysm is identified, A complete peripheral arterial examination should be performed looking for evidence of distal embolization, ischemia, or associated peripheral artery aneurysms (femoral, popliteal).\nThe iliac arteries lie deep in the pelvis and are usually not palpable, even if they were an aneurysm.\n\n\n\nAuscultation\n\nCardiac auscultation is performed for rate and rhythm. And attention to any arrhythmias, gallops, and murmurs.\nBruits in the abdomen is associated with arterial stenosis. The origin of the bruit could be renal, mesenteric, or aortic iliac. In young females, the bruit may reflect fibromuscular dysplasia.\n\n\n\n\nLower Extremity Exam:\n\nInspection\n\nPallor, cyanosis, poor capillary refill are signs of chronic limb ischemia. Muscle atrophy, hair loss, and thick toenails may also be present.\nDependent rubor and pallor with elevation indicate advanced peripheral occlusive disease. Dependent rubor is hyperemic erythematous discoloration of the limb in a dependent position (sitting or standing). Dependent rubor is due to the maximal dilation of the capillaries and the effect of gravity. However, the limb becomes pale once the foot is elevated (the patient lies down). It is usually associated with rest pain and edema. It is frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis.\nUlcers need to be identified as neuropathic ulcers or ischemic ulcers. Neuropathic ulcers are at pressure points over the plantar aspect of the metatarsal head. Ischemic ulcers are more on the tip of the toes.\n\nLivedo Reticularis: Violaceous mottling of the skin with a reticular pattern of the skin of the arms and legs. The term” livedo racemosa” is used for cutaneous findings in inflammatory or thrombotic vascular disease patients.\nAcrocyanosis: is defined as bluish discoloration of the extremities due to high deoxygenated blood in the capillaries. It is a persistent disorder without episodic triphasic color response.\n\nMicroembolic disease can manifest as blue toe syndrome/trash foot.\nDry skin is present in chronic limb ischemia because the sebaceous glands are not working well.\nEdema is called “pitting” when the indentation persists after applying pressure to a small area. Pitting edema is associated with systemic diseases like heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hypoproteinemia, or local disease of the veins or lymphatic. Non-pitting edema is observed when the indentation does not persist. It is associated with Myxedema, lipedema, and advanced lymphedema.\n\nClaudication: claudicates may have no significant finding on inspection. They may have muscle atrophy or hair loss:\n\n\n\nAuscultation\n\nAuscultation over the femoral region for any bruits. Auscultation may also find continuous bruits characterized by an arterio-venous fistula.\n\n\n\nPalpation\n\nFemoral pulse: palpated under the inguinal ligament, two-finger breaths from the pubic tubercle.\n\nPopliteal pulse: with the patient’s knee flexed, both hands are wrapped around the knee tendons, and the tips of the fingertips are pressed into the popliteal space. The pulse is lightly lateral. A normal popliteal artery may not be palpable.\n\nDorsalis Pedis: palpated in the dorsum of the foot between the first and second extensor tendons.\nPostier tibial: pulse is found behind the medial malleolus. It is easier to palpable with the foot passively dorsiflexed.\n\nPeroneal artery: not palpable.\n\nIt is common not to palpate either the Dorsalis Pedis or posterior tibial pulse, but not in the same foot.\nWhen a pulse is not palpated, a Doppler is used to assess the blood flow. The Doppler signal can be triphasic, or biphasic, or monophasic.\n\nTriphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood flow.\n\nMonophasic signal correlates with moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood flow.\n\nIn severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.\n\nTemperature changes may help demarcate the level of disease.\n\nSensory loss may be present in acute ischemia and chronic neuropathy."
