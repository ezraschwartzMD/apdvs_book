# Preface {.unnumbered}

This content was developed as part of the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery's (APDVS) medical student curriculum. Each chapter covers a key domain of vascular surgery pathology and treatment and is associated with an Audible Bleeding episode which you can access from the link embedded in the text.

This eBook would not have been possible without the [Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS)](https://vascular.org/apdvs), the guidance and resources of [Dr. Sharif Ellozy](https://twitter.com/SharifEllozy) and [Dr. Adam Johnson](https://twitter.com/Adam_mdmph), the [Audible Bleeding Vascular Surgery Exam Prep project](https://adam-mdmph.quarto.pub/vascular-surgery-exam-prep/), and the [Audible Bleeding Team](https://www.audiblebleeding.com/about-1/). This project is the direct result of [Dr. Chelsea Dorsey](https://twitter.com/MdDorsey) et al.'s medical education research (see below) and the work of the [Society of Vascular Surgery's Resident Student Outreach Committee (SVS RSOC)](https://vascular.org/about/councils-and-committees/education-council/resident-and-student-outreach-committee).
